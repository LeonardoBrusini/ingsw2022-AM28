# Requirements
-----------------------------------------------------
## Windows
Download and install JAVA DEVELOPER KIT - https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk18-windows
Then set JAVA_HOME - <jdk folder path> and Path - <jdk folder path>\bin environment variables.

## MacOs
Download and install JDK FX - https://www.azul.com/downloads/?version=java-18-sts&os=macos&architecture=arm-64-bit&package=jdk-fx

# Launch server and clients using JAR file:
-----------------------------------------------------
## CLI configuration
1. Download Windows Terminal (unlike the classic cmd, it supports all necessary unicode characters)
   https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701
2. From WINDOWS 10/11, go to SETTINGS -> Date / time and language -> LANGUAGE -> Settings
   language administration -> Administration options -> Change system locale.
   Add the check to "use UTF-8 unicode for high level language support"

Open server from terminal typing "java -jar <file path> -s [port]".
   
Oper CLI client from terminal typing "java -jar <file path> -c [server ip] [server port]".

## GUI
Double click on the jar file. Server ip and port will be asked on title screen.
--------------------------------------------------------
   
You need at least 1 server and 2 clients are required to start the client
if you want to start a client on another pc:
- if the pc is on another network than the server -> you need a port forwarding and the IP of the server network
- if the pc is on the same network as the server -> the local IP of the server is required
